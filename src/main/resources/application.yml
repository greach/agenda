However, there are a few caveats that might be overlooked or things we take for granted in this process.'
        - 'Our main product, Todoist, had a complex hierarchy of Java POJOs used to parse the API responses, local DB models, along with a few other utilities. All this added up to a total of over 8k LOC.'
        - 'We’ve recently decided to modernize that part of our system by converting it all to Kotlin.'
        - 'We had a few requirements to consider this refactoring successful:'
        - '- Ensure these models were usable in both Android and JVM-only projects;'
        - '- Ensure that an open-source version of these POJOs was still available to the community that wanted to do something related to [Todoist](https://github.com/Doist/TodoistPojos)'
        - '- Ensure we got additional benefits from it - just reducing the number of LOC wasn’t a plausible justification for such an endeavour. It ended up taking about 2 months from the beginning of the implementation to the complete stabilisation in production, passing by testing and code review;'
        - 'This talk will highlight the process we’ve adopted, the lessons we’ve learned and some other interesting takeaways. The goal is that you know how to deal with similar cases in the future and, most importantly, be aware of Kotlin’s quirks and features and leverage them in the best way possible.'

Some might hear about Jenkins Shared Libraries, a way to share the common pipeline code between multiple pipelines. But not many people had an opportunity to implement and maintain Jenkins Shared Library used by hundreds of active Jenkins pipelines. In this talk, I want to show you the journey that Upwork, a global online freelancing platform, went from a Jenkins v1 freestyle jobs to the Jenkins 2 declarative pipelines delivered as a shared library. I will show you the mistakes we made, the tools we used to automate the shared library releasing process, and some numbers and metrics that helped us make the right decisions. '

        - 'There''s a strong feeling that people don''t upgrade their Java version because they are scared of what''s going on with newer Java releases, especially after that moment when the release cadence has changed. So many OpenJDK projects have an open target, which makes people feel like there''s nothing happening with them because delivery time takes years, and so on. It feels like you are one of those developers, team leaders, managers who stuck with older versions of Java for certain reasons. And only things you have heard about modern Java that are freighting you so much? Let me ask you a few questions:'
        - '- How good you know modern Java?'
        - '- How good you know modern Java features?'
        - '- Aren’t you afraid of it yet?'
        - 'If you are one of those then this talk is for you (and your manager). In this talk. I’d like to talk 6 signs that you have no idea of what’s going on with modern Java:'
        - '- Java modules, no thank you;'
        - '- Java is not good for the cloud;'
        - '- JavaFX is dead;'
        - ' - OpenJDK projects (Valhalla, Loom, Panama) are cool, but no visual progress so far;'
        - ' - Java is not evolving; - GraalVM will replace Java HotSpot VM'

        - 'Bill Gates once said 640k should be enough for anyone. History showed that wasn''t the case for a while. But with the advent of Cloud computing we have to rethink how big our applications should be, as well as how quickly they must be ready to start serving requests. Enter Micronaut, a refreshing framework that can be used to build traditional web applications as well as tiny microservices and anything in between. In this workshop you''ll get started with the basics, domain design, database acces, view scaffolding, monitoring, and more.'
